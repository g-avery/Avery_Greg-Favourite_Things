Favourite Things Roadmap


Description:
        
A mobile-first responsive page featuring 3 of my favourite things. Content on the page will be taken from a database with more than 4 columns in it. As part of the database, an image and item id will be included. 




Steps:
1. Create a database in MySQL
2. Create an app design and make it responsive
3. Link database to the app using PHP and javascript
4. Make sure everything is working




Considerations:
-when creating the database, make sure to use correct types (varchar/int…) for each name
        -make sure to run code through Postman to check if the backend is working
