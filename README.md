# Favourite Things

### Overview
This page is the part of the "Favourite Things" project. On here, you can find three of my favourite things. They are stored in a database and are retrieved using some PHP and Javascript. 

### Getting Started
To view the page, clone this to the location of your choice, and open the ".html" file.
You can also view the source code by opening it in any code editing program of your choice, or clicking inspect in a chrome tab.
The written plan and the database file for this project can be found in the assets folder.

### Prerequisites
All you need to run this page is an up to date browser and all the files included.
